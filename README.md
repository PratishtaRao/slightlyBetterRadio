# Intro

The goal of this project is to make radio bearable. We propose to achieve this task using machine learning to classify audio streams into two categories -- Ads and music. 

## First stage
- Build classifier that categorizes an audio sample into either 'ad' or 'music'

## Second stage
Some find the discussions on radio streams to be interesting. Such portion deserver their own label and our classifier should be able to extend to this
- Add 'talk' label to the classifier. 
    - Train on generate conversation patterns perhaps?
- Recognize song titles
    - Should be straigtforward to use a shazam-like API to figure out which song the classified sample belongs to
   
   
## Working on this project

- Always work on a branch and then send a pull request.
- Review outstanding PRs. If you do not feel comfortable merging PRs, comment with a "+1" to signal your co-collaborators that it's passed your review.
- Feel free to push directly to master only for micro-fixes such as typos.
